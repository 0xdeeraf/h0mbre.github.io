## Introduction
Continuing on with the Windows exploit journey, it's time to start exploiting device drivers and learning about writing exploits for ring 0. As I did with my OSCE prep, I'm mainly blogging my progress as a way for me to reinforce concepts and keep meticulous notes I can reference later on. I can't tell you how many times I've used my own blog as a reference for something I learned 3 months ago and had totally forgotten. 

This series will be me attempting to run through every exploit on the [Hacksys Extreme Vulnerable Driver](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver). **I will be using HEVD 2.0**. I can't even begin to explain how amazing a training tool like this is for those of us just starting out. There are a ton of good blog posts out there walking through various HEVD exploits. I recommend you read them all! I referenced them heavily as I tried to complete these exploits. Almost nothing I do or say in this blog will be new or my own thoughts/ideas/techniques. There were instances where I diverged from any strategies I saw employed in the blogposts out of necessity or me trying to do my own thing to learn more. I used the following blogs as references:
