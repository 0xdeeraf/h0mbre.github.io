## Offset.py

Just thought I'd show a few use cases for a little helper script I created to automate some things for CTP. DISCLAIMER: Outside of the testing I did during writing the script and this post, the script hasn't been fully vetted. Definitely reach out to me if you find anything wrong with the calcuations and opcodes. 

I couldn't quite get alphanumeric ESP adjustments to work in the script for larger offsets (256-9999) the way I wanted, hopefully I'll be able to add those at some point soon. 

## Default Mode

In default mode, we simply feed the script two addresses and if our offset is in the 1-255 decimal range, we should get back the following:
+ hex offset,
+ decimal offset,
+ negative jump short opcodes (if offset is 1-128),
+ positive jump short opcodes (if offset is 1-128),
+ ESP adjustment opcodes using `SUB` for alphanumeric encoded shellcode, and
+ ESP adjustment opcodes using `ADD` for alphanumeric encoded shellcode. 

### Example (Offset 1-255)

In this example we use the addresses `0174FFFF` and `0174FFCC`.
