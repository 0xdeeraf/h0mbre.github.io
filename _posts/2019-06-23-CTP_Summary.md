## CTP/OSCE Prep Conclusion

At this point we have touched on all of the topics I wanted to cover before my exam. We covered:
+ alphanumeric shellcoding,
+ egghunters,
+ SEH overwrites,
+ stuffing shellcode into memory separate from crash payload, and
+ fuzzing.

For completeness, I'm going to include all of the references I found useful and also some resources for some topics we didn't cover such as
