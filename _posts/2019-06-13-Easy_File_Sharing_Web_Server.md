## Introduction

This series of posts will focus on the concepts I'm learning/practicing in preparation for [CTP/OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/cracking-the-perimeter/). In this series of posts, I plan on exploring:
+ fuzzing,
+ vanilla EIP overwrite,
+ SEH overwrite, and
+ egghunters.

Writing these entries will force me to become intimately familiar with these topics, and hopefully you can get something out of them as well! 

This particular post is about recreating an SEH Overwrite from an exploitdb entry.

## Finding a Candidate Exploit

Since I've just about finished all of the Vulnserver exploits and have gone through most of the CTP material, I figured it's time to start getting some experience recreating real world exploits from scratch. 

## Fuzzing
