## Introduction
In this episode of 'Fuzzing like a Caveman', we'll be continuing on our by noob for noobs fuzzing journey and trying to wrap our little baby fuzzing brains around the concept of code coverage and why its so important. As far as I know, code coverage is, at a high-level, the attempt made by fuzzers to track/increase how much of the target application's code is reached by the fuzzer's inputs. The idea being that the more code your fuzzer inputs reach, the greater the attack surface, the more comprehensive your testing is, and other big brain stuff that I don't understand yet. 

I've been working on my pwn skills, but taking short breaks for sanity to write some C and watch some @gamazolabs streams. @gamazolabs broke down the importance of code coverage during one of these streams, and I cannot for the life of me track down the clip, but I remembered it vaguely enough to set up some test cases just for my own testing to demonstrate why "dumb" fuzzers are so disadvantaged compared to code-coverage-guided fuzzers. Get ready for some (probably incorrect ðŸ¤£) 8th grade probability theory. By the end of this blog post, we should be able to at least understand broadly how state of the art fuzzers worked in 1990. 

## Our Fuzzer
We have this beautiful, error free, perfectly written, single-threaded jpeg mutation fuzzer that we've ported to C from our previous blog posts and tweaked a bit for the purposes of our experiments here.

Not going to spend a lot of time on the fuzzer's features (what features?) here, but some important things about the fuzzer code:
+ it takes a file as input and copies the bytes from the file into a buffer
+ it calculates the length of the buffer in bytes, and then mutates 2% of the bytes by randomly overwriting them with arbitrary bytes
+ the function responsible for the mutation, `create_new`, doesn't keep track of what byte indexes were mutated so theoretically, the same index could be chosen for mutation multiple times, so really, the fuzzer mutates **up to** 2% of the bytes. 

### Small Detour, I Apologize 
We only have one mutation method here to keep things super simple, in doing so, I actually learned something really useful that I hadn't clearly thought out previously. In a previous post I wondered, embarrassingly, aloud and in print, how much different random bit flipping was from random byte overwriting (flipping?). Well, it turns out, they are super different. Let's take a minute to see how. 

Let's say we're mutating an array of bytes called `bytes`. We're mutating index 5. `bytes[5]` == `\x41` `(65 in decimal)` in the unmutated, pristine original file. If we *only* bit flip, we are super limited in how much we can mutate this byte. 65 is `01000001` in binary. Let's just go through at see how much it changes from arbitrarily flipping one bit:
+ Flipping first bit: `11000001` = 193,
+ Flipping second bit: `00000001` = 1,
+ Flipping third bit: `01100001` = 97,
+ Flipping fourth bit: `01010001` = 81,
+ Flipping fifth bit: `01001001` = 73,
+ Flipping sixth bit: `01000101` = 69,
+ Flipping seventh bit: `01000011` = 67, and
+ Flipping eighth bit: `010000001` = 64.

As you can see, we're locked in to a severely limited amount of possibilities. 

## Vulnerable Program
I wrote a simple cartoonish program to demonstrate how hard it can be for "dumb" fuzzers to find bugs. Imagine a target a application that has several decision trees in the disassembly map view of the binary. The application performs 2-3 checks on the input to see if it meets certain criteria before passing the input to some sort of vulnerable function. Here is what I mean:
