## Introduction

This series of posts will focus on the concepts I'm learning/practicing in preparation for [CTP/OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/cracking-the-perimeter/). In this series of posts, I plan on exploring:
+ fuzzing,
+ vanilla EIP overwrite,
+ SEH overwrite, and
+ egghunters.

Writing these entries will force me to become intimately familiar with these topics, and hopefully you can get something out of them as well! 

In this particular post, we will be approaching an overflow in the `LTER` parameter trying to utilize all the tricks we've learned thus far. 

If you have not already done so, please read some of the posts in the 'CTP/OSCE Prep' series as this post will be light on review! 

**This post will assume the reader is already familiar with how to attach processes in Immunity, use boofuzz, search for bad characters, and other knowledge domains covered in the first post of the series.**

## Big Thanks

To everyone who has published free intro-level 32 bit exploit dev material, I'm super appreciative. Truly mean it.
