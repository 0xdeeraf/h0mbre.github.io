## Introduction

This series of posts will focus on the concepts I'm learning/practicing in preparation for [CTP/OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/cracking-the-perimeter/). In this series of posts, I plan on exploring:
+ fuzzing,
+ vanilla EIP overwrite,
+ SEH overwrite, and
+ egghunters.

Writing these entries will force me to become intimately familiar with these topics, and hopefully you can get something out of them as well! 

In this particular post, we will become acquainted with an SEH-based overflow with the `GMON` command/parameter in Vulnserver. 

If you have not already done so, please read the first post of this series so that you can setup your environment, setup and use `boofuzz`, and become acquainted with some of the stack-based overflow concepts that are still relevant in this post. You can do so [here](https://h0mbre.github.io/Boofuzz_to_EIP_Overwrite/).
