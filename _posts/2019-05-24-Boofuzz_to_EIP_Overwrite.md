## Introduction

This series of posts will focus on the concepts I'm learning/practicing in preparation for [CTP/OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/cracking-the-perimeter/) In this series of posts, I plan on exploring:
+ fuzzing,
+ vanilla EIP overwrite,
+ SEH overwrite, and
+ egghunters.

Writing these entries will force me to become intimately familiar with these topics, and hopefully you can get something out of them as well! 

In this particular post, we will become acquainted with the `boofuzz` fuzzer and use it to discover an EIP overwrite vulnerability in Vulnserver. 

## Preparing Our Environment

For this excercise we will need to procure:
+ Windows 7 VM,
+ boofuzz,
+ vulnserver, and
+ a remote attacker box (I'll be using Kali).

For my lab setup, I downloaded an x86 Windows 7 image for Virtualbox [directly from Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) and took a snapshot so that in 90 days, if I still want the VM I won't have to start the process of installing and configuring it from scratch! 

I found that when I downloaded and booted the 'VMware x86" images, they were in fact 64-bit, so beware of that possibility. 

Next we will need to install boofuzz on our attacker box. If you are on a Debian-based Linux machine, you can run the following commands (assuming you don't need to `sudo` because you are a script-kiddie like me in perma-root on Kali):
1. `git clone https://github.com/jtpereyda/boofuzz`
2. `cd boofuzz`
3. `pip install .`
